# Design System

This is a boilerplate of a design system generated by `@genesisx/design-system`. Learn more about it on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genesisx/design-system) or the [Genesis docs app](https://genesisx.netlify.app/docs/design-system).

## UI Library

Checkout the UI library in `libs/ui`. It follows [Atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) (atoms > molecules > organisms > templates > pages) out of the box.
Start creating your components now using the below command:

```sh
pnpm generate
```
